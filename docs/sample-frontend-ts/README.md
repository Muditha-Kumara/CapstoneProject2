# Sample Frontend (TypeScript Demo)

This is a standalone TypeScript demo created only for documentation purposes.  
It does NOT affect the real NourishNet frontend.

## Features
- TypeScript React components
- Typed API mock functions
- Component props with interfaces
- Example pages (Home, About, Dashboard)
- Example reusable UI components

## How to Run (Optional)
This demo is not required to be executed, but if needed:

cd docs/sample-frontend-ts
npm install
npm run dev


This project exists to demonstrate how NourishNet could be migrated to TypeScript in the future.
