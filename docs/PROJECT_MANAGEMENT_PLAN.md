## Daily & Weekly Workflow

### Daily Standup Schedule
**Time:** 9:00 AM (15 minutes daily)  
**Format:** 
- What did you accomplish yesterday?
- What will you work on today?
- Any blockers or dependencies?

### Weekly Sprint Planning
**Schedule:** Every Monday at 2:00 PM (1 hour)  
**Activities:**
- Review previous week's progress
- Plan upcoming week's tasks
- Adjust priorities and timelines
- Address any technical challenges

### Code Review Process
- All code must be reviewed by at least one team member
- No direct pushes to `main` branch
- Use feature branches for all development
- Automated testing must pass before merge

## Risk Management & Contingency Plans

### High-Risk Areas
1. **API Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Early API contract definition and mock implementations
   
2. **Third-party Service Dependencies**
   - Mitigation: Have backup solutions ready (e.g., alternative payment processors)
   
3. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Regular performance testing and optimization sprints
   
4. **Team Member Availability**
   - Mitigation: Cross-training and knowledge sharing sessions

### Buffer Time Allocation
- 10% buffer time built into each milestone
- Last week reserved for unexpected issues and polish

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Code Quality
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Pre-commit hooks for code formatting
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- TypeScript for type safety

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Component documentation with Storybook
- Deployment and setup guides
- Code comments for complex business logic

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing for key workflows

## Professional Development Showcase

### Portfolio Preparation
- Clean, well-documented codebase
- Live demo deployment
