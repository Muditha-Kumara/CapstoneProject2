# Time Sheet

### Subject: Grade feedback request

Dear Teacher,

I am writing again because I have not received a reply regarding my grade (1) for the project.

I am very concerned about this result. I have a 4.6 overall grade, and our team followed all the instructions on itslearning. We put a lot of effort into the technologies and the report. All our work is documented in our Git repository and commit.

I have not uploaded my timesheet yet. I am waiting for your feedback or a correction of the grade before I submit it. Once we clarify the issue, I will upload the timesheet immediately.

Could you please let me know why the grade is low and how I can fix it?

Thank you,
