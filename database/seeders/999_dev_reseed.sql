-- DEV ONLY: This script can be used to re-seed the database in development.
-- You can run this manually in Adminer or psql if you need to reload seed data.
-- Example: \i /docker-entrypoint-initdb-seed.d/001_seed_data.sql
-- (Or use Adminer to run the contents of 001_seed_data.sql)

-- Uncomment and copy the contents of 001_seed_data.sql here if you want to re-seed.
-- DELETE FROM ...; -- (truncate tables as needed)
-- INSERT INTO ...; -- (re-insert seed data)
